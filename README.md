#  Tennis Tracker

A full-stack web application built with Django REST Framework that allows users to track favourite tennis players, view personalised match schedules, and receive automated match reminders.

The backend is designed using RESTful principles with secure JWT-based authentication and user-specific data access. Asynchronous tasks such as match updates and reminder notifications are handled using Celery with Redis, ensuring non-blocking API performance and scalability.

The frontend consumes the backend APIs to present a clean and responsive user interface, maintaining clear separation between client and server responsibilities.

This project demonstrates practical experience in backend development, including API design, authentication, background job processing, and integration of frontend and backend systems.
